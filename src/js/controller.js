//Note: to use live server extension for development, you need to change the folder name in the setting of workspace which starts like this: " Live Server › Settings: Multi Root Workspace Name This the entry point of server when you're in multiroot workspace ". there you need to change the name of the file from 'allexamstable project' to 'd3js charting' folder name. 


import {csv, 
        select,
        // format
    } from 'd3';// all of the deconstructed words here are actually functions or SuperConcept functions that gives you access to another function when right parameter is passed into them. like sya axisLeft(). axisLeft(yourchoiceofaxis) will actually return another function, which will actually takes as the parameter to itself the append instructions on the svg1 selection. 
import {scatterPlot} from './scatterplot';

/*SuperNote:-
    0️⃣D3.js is highly dependent on method chaining.
    1️⃣ScaleLinear: it sets the linear function between Domain and Range. Domain: is the sample space from where the input to a function is possible. Range: is the sample space, only within which, the output to the function is possible.  
    2️⃣ ScalePoint: is used to plot the values which are strings.
    3️⃣ScaleOrdinal:
    4️⃣ScalePow: is used to set exponential relation in function between Domain and Range. 
    5️⃣extent: returns an array after processing an array of values. This array has two value, one max and other min. 
    6️⃣ how .call statement works. abc.call(xyz) simply means that xyz(abc); where xyz() is a function and abc is the parameter being passed into xyz();
    7️⃣Super svg.append(g):- this as soon as envoked;  makes a brand new d3 selection of a brandnew DOM element which is a group element. there group element in d3.js is represented using the letter 'g'. 
    8️⃣SuperConcept"implicit return":- this kind of return is found in arrow function with single line of code in their body. There are arrow functions with multiple lines  of body put inside the curly brance. But these don't have implicit return into them.you will have to write the return statment explicitly. But if you want to use the implicit return feature and multiple lines as well, then you better wrap you body of function within () braces. which may look like: const fun1= (abc)=>({and here your multipline code.}); 
    9️⃣SuperNoteMarvel
    Note that we are using this expression from d3.js axis documentation.Super There they had used underscore _ as the name of the variable in getter, setter function. Hence, i am using it as well. Not get bothered. It's just being used as variable name.LearnByHeartTake A Good LookRemember It "height = +_, my" this expression has a great Concept hidden in it. There is implicit return involved in it. That is inside a ternarry operation, like (condition)?(expression1, expression2):(); when "condition" is checked, if the condition is found true, then (expression1,expression2) section is executed. now SuperNoteVIE "expression1" is calculated and "expression2" is always returned IMPLICITLY. That's how this construct works in JS , this property is to facilitate method chaining.LearnByHeartJust Beautiful
    🔟SuperNoteConcept 
    we can't use arrow function in getter , setter funtion becouse "argument" parameter object isn't defined.(Remember It "arguments" is as special keyword in JS .) like if you say let f= ()=> console.log(arguments); the output will give error that arguments isn't defined. but if you use old school function syntax like let f = function() {console.log(arguments)}, this will not throw error. it will only say that arugments is undefined. if you pass f(1,2,3), then the output will be Arguments(3)[1,2,3]. 
    How ever, there is a work around this limitation. 
    1️⃣1️⃣after modularation of code, we have turned the rValue() function not into getter or setter function, but into a full fledged rValueCalculated() function and hence, it return radius values not the "my" in scatterplot.js . Becouse there is no point in making it into a getter or setter function if the radius is variable and has to be calculated internally from the data accessed. If the radius were to be constant, then using getter, setter makes a sense. 
    1️⃣2️⃣ controller.js is basically the area where you have all the section of code that you will need to change or configure for different types of data. Within main(), we are calling scatterplot() and adding all configuration to it. 
    1️⃣3️⃣in Scatterplot.js we have all the data that need very few and far in between changes, basically, they are static code for data visualisation. hence it has been put to another module for better code visibility in controller.js
    1️⃣4️⃣setInterval() is best to use when you are going to use it for duration of longer time scale and not for any animation related rendering.
    1️⃣5️⃣requestAnimationFrames() is best used for small scale time duration and specially for Animation related implementation. It has better settings for the synchronization and controls in between with your display and rendering w.r.t set Interval.

//VIEConcept Now i will define "Accessor functions". They are used to set value in "Idempotent style" of programming. In this, we program in a manner that user need not remember the "order and number of parameter" to be given to the function. You can pass the parameters in much more fluid manner, not totally fluid, but fluid to a great extent. They are very useful in largescale programming.
